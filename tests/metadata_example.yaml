  # Berke Lab currently uses 2 possible probes for the hex maze task, specified below.
  # Un-comment the probe used for your experiment.
  device:
    name: "256-ch Silicon Probe, 3mm length, 66um pitch"
    description: >
      32 shanks, 8 electrodes per shank. Each shank is 3mm long. 
      Shanks are 66um apart. There is 30um between electrodes on each shank. 
      Odd shanks are vertically offset by 1/2 the electrode pitch (15um).
