  device:
    name: "256-ch Silicon Probe, 3mm length, 66um pitch"
    description: >
      32 shanks, 8 electrodes per shank. Each shank is 3mm long. 
      Shanks are 66um apart. There is 30um between electrodes on each shank. 
      Odd shanks are vertically offset by 1/2 the electrode pitch (15um).

notes:
  General notes about this session, if any. 
  For example - Reward used was 15uL sucrose solution (10% sucrose, 0.1% NaCl) 
  at each reward port. The rat was water deprived before the experiment. 
  Behavior was ok, but this rat likes to climb over the barriers.
