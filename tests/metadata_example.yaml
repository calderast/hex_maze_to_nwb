# If your experiment included electrophysiology, include field 'ephys' and the following subfields:
ephys:

  plug_order: "chip_first" # "chip_first" or "cable_first". Defaults to "chip_first" if none specified

  # If you have spike sorting data, specify the following ephys subfields:
  mountain_sort_output_file_path: "tests/test_data/processed_ephys/firings.mda"

  # Berke Lab currently uses 2 possible probes for the hex maze task, specified below.

  device:
    name: "256-ch Silicon Probe, 3mm length, 66um pitch"
    description: >
      32 shanks, 8 electrodes per shank. Each shank is 3mm long. 
      Shanks are 66um apart. There is 30um between electrodes on each shank. 
      Odd shanks are vertically offset by 1/2 the electrode pitch (15um).
    manufacturer: "Daniel Egert, Berke Lab"

surgery:

notes:
  General notes about this session, if any. 
  For example - Reward used was 15uL sucrose solution (10% sucrose, 0.1% NaCl) 
  at each reward port. The rat was water deprived before the experiment. 
  Behavior was ok, but this rat likes to climb over the barriers.
