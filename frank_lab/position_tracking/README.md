Some code to find the centroids of each hex given a video file(s). These coordinates should be the same across multiple sessions as long as the maze and camera do not move.


`Xulu_hex_coordinates.xlsx` contains hex centroids in both pixels and cm (given the scale factor = 0.16 cm per pixel) for Xulu's maze, based on the videos in the `video_files/` folder.
